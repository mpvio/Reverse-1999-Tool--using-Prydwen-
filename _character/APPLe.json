His damage is on the low end and he isn't suited for burst healing, but he can still be useful in the early gameâ€”especially since the game reimburses you with the materials spent upgrading him to Insight I.",

Its increase to APPLe's personal ATK also boosts his ultimate and skill healing.\nMelodies Old and New is another great supportive psychube; 3-9% DMG Bonus for the whole team and 12-16% Healing Bonus is a great way to make APPLe more useful.\nLaughter and Laughter is completely free and super cheap to build. It takes some time to stack up, but nothing beats a cheap beginner build to get you through the early chapters of the game.\nTake the Hard Journey increases his healing. APPLe's low DEF makes the passive healing bonus easy to trigger.\nDespite having his face on it, An Afternoon Nap isn't particularly good for APPLe. His ultimate is AoE and he doesn't even have very high Critical Rate, so the Critical DMG isn't very relevant.",
